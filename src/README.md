## `derive_mccabe_quantiles.R`

Reconstructs the quantile distributions for the two McCabe et al. outbreak-size
estimates and (re)writes the corresponding `model-output/mccabe-*` CSV files.

The McCabe et al. paper (Lancet Infect Dis 2026,
[doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(26)00299-9](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(26)00299-9),
code at <https://github.com/mrc-ide/evd-2026-outbreak-size>) reports a point
estimate and a 95% confidence interval for each method, "as of 27 May 2026". The
script reconstructs the full sampling distribution implied by each reported
interval and reads off the 7 hubverse quantiles:

- **Method 1 (back-calculation):** `1.879846 × Gamma(shape = 240.5, rate = 1)`,
  with the 2.5% quantile anchored to the paper's reported CI lower bound (396).
- **Method 2 (geographical spread):**
  `qnbinom(p, size = 3, prob = 0.0031736) + 3`.

These intervals reflect only the sampling uncertainty in the observed counts
(deaths for Method 1, exported cases for Method 2); they do **not** propagate
parameter uncertainty in the CFR, attributable-death fraction, travel volumes,
source population, or growth rate. See the `IMPORTANT UNCERTAINTY CAVEAT` in
each `model-metadata/mccabe-*.yml`. These estimates were transcribed by the hub,
not submitted by the original authors.

### Usage

```sh
Rscript src/derive_mccabe_quantiles.R
```

Re-running the script reproduces the committed CSVs exactly. It depends only on
base R (`qgamma`, `qnbinom`).
